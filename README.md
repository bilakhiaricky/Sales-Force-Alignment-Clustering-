# Sales-Force-Alignment-Clustering-
Define and align the most effective and balanced sales territories based on geography and physician prescribing habits, in order to maximize promotion of new medications.  Pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars annually on their sales force in order to promote recently discovered medications, thereby increasing their company’s revenue.  The sales force is aligned with geographical territories that are defined  to maximize representative effectiveness and reach, and minimize travel time, while providing “fair” and approximately equal sales potential for each representative.
